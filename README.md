This project implements the StringVector class in C++, which manages a collection of words stored in a vector for efficient text analysis. The focus is on analyzing large text files, such as books from the Project Gutenberg Ebook collection, by providing methods for reading, storing, and searching words using both linear and binary search techniques.

The main functionality involves counting the total number of words and identifying unique words in a text file. The project compares two search methods—linear search for unsorted data and recursive binary search for sorted data—and demonstrates how binary search improves runtime performance, especially with large datasets.

Additionally, the project compares this vector-based binary search approach to a linked list implementation used in a previous project. The comparison shows that binary search on a sorted vector is significantly more efficient than using a linked list for the same task.

By using object-oriented programming and recursion, this project ensures quick and accurate searches through large text files, with binary search outperforming the linked list approach in terms of runtime efficiency.
