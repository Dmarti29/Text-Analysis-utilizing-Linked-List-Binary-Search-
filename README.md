This project implements the StringVector class in C++, which manages a collection of words stored in a vector for efficient text analysis. The focus is on analyzing large text files, such as books from the Project Gutenberg Ebook collection, by providing methods for reading, storing, and searching for words using binary_search

The main functionality involves counting the total number of words and identifying unique words in a text file. The project focuses on how binary_search is the most efficient when dealing with large text files

Additionally, the project compares this vector-based binary search approach to a linked list implementation used in a previous project. The comparison shows that binary search on a sorted vector is significantly more efficient than using a linked list for the same task.

By using object-oriented programming and recursion, this project ensures quick and accurate searches through large text files, with binary search outperforming the linked list approach in terms of runtime efficiency.
