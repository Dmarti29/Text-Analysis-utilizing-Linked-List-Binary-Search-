This project implements the StringVector class in C++, which manages a collection of words stored in a vector for text analysis. The focus of the project is on efficiently analyzing large text files, such as books from the Project Gutenberg Ebook collection, by providing methods for reading, storing, and searching words using both linear and binary search techniques.

The primary functionality revolves around counting the total number of words in a text file and identifying the number of unique words. The system supports two different search methodsâ€”linear search for unsorted data and recursive binary search for sorted data. The binary search method improves runtime performance, especially when dealing with large datasets, by ensuring the word list remains sorted.

This project also includes a comparison between the StringVector class and a linked list implementation used in a previous project. Both data structures were used to store words and perform text analysis, with binary search on the vector being compared to the linked list approach for identifying unique words. The results demonstrated that binary search, when combined with sorted data in a vector, was significantly more efficient in terms of runtime compared to the linked list approach.

By leveraging object-oriented programming and recursive algorithms, this project enables quick and accurate searches through large text files, ensuring that the unique word count is correct and that the total number of words is accurately tracked. Additionally, the project highlights the performance improvements that binary search offers over linked lists when managing large datasets.
